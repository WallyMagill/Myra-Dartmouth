## Coach Dashboard Features

### 1. Athlete Management
**Goal:** View, add, edit, and delete athletes.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/athletes` endpoints support all CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    - Add Zod validation for input data.
2. **Frontend**
    - Build a table/list to display all athletes.
    - Add a modal or form for adding a new athlete.
    - Add edit/delete actions for each athlete (modal or inline form).
    - Use the API client to connect UI actions to backend endpoints.
3. **Data Flow**
    - On page load, fetch all athletes.
    - On add/edit/delete, update the list in real time.

---

### 2. Test Protocol Creation
**Goal:** Create, edit, and delete test protocols for different modalities.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/protocols` endpoints support all CRUD operations.
    - Protocols should include name, description, test type, and stages.
2. **Frontend**
    - Build a list/table of protocols.
    - Add a form/modal for creating/editing protocols (with dynamic stage fields).
    - Add delete functionality.
    - Use the API client for all actions.
3. **Data Flow**
    - Fetch protocols on page load.
    - Update list on create/edit/delete.

---

### 3. Schedule Management
**Goal:** Manage test schedules and appointments.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/schedules` endpoints support all CRUD operations.
    - Schedules should include start/end time, title, description, location, type, and status.
2. **Frontend**
    - Build a calendar or list view of schedules.
    - Add forms for creating/editing schedules.
    - Add delete functionality.
    - Use the API client for all actions.
3. **Data Flow**
    - Fetch schedules on page load.
    - Update view on create/edit/delete.

---

### 4. Performance Analysis
**Goal:** Analyze athlete performance and trends.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/test-sessions` returns all relevant test data (with athlete, protocol, and results).
2. **Frontend**
    - Use Chart.js or Recharts to visualize test data (e.g., lactate threshold, heart rate trends).
    - Allow filtering by athlete, protocol, or date range.
3. **Data Flow**
    - Fetch test session data and render charts.

---

### 5. Notes & Feedback
**Goal:** Leave notes and feedback for athletes.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Add notes/feedback fields to test sessions or create a new notes model if needed.
    - Ensure endpoints support adding and retrieving notes.
2. **Frontend**
    - Add a form for submitting notes/feedback.
    - Display notes per athlete or per test session.
3. **Data Flow**
    - Fetch and display notes; allow adding new notes.

---

### 6. Test Data Entry
**Goal:** Enter test results for athletes during/after sessions.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/test-sessions` supports creating and updating test data (lactate, heart rate, etc.).
2. **Frontend**
    - Build a form for entering test data (select athlete, protocol, input results).
    - Validate and submit data to the backend.
3. **Data Flow**
    - On submit, update the relevant test session.

---

## Athlete Dashboard Features

### 1. Pre-test Assessment
**Goal:** Complete a pre-test assessment before each session.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Add pre-test assessment fields to test sessions or create a new model.
    - Ensure endpoints support submitting and retrieving assessments.
2. **Frontend**
    - Build a form for the assessment.
    - Submit and display assessment results.

---

### 2. Performance Tracking
**Goal:** Track performance and progress over time.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/test-sessions` returns all relevant test data for the logged-in athlete.
2. **Frontend**
    - Use Chart.js or Recharts to visualize the athlete's own test data.
    - Allow filtering by protocol or date.

---

### 3. Schedule Viewing
**Goal:** View upcoming test schedule.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Ensure `/api/schedules` returns only the athlete's relevant schedules.
2. **Frontend**
    - Display a list or calendar of upcoming tests.

---

### 4. Coach Communication
**Goal:** Message coach and receive feedback.

**Steps:**
1. **Backend**
    - Add messaging or feedback fields to the database (or use notes/feedback from coach).
    - Ensure endpoints support sending and retrieving messages/feedback.
2. **Frontend**
    - Build a messaging or feedback display UI.
    - Allow athletes to view and respond to coach feedback.

## General Implementation Notes
- **Role-based Access:**
  - Protect all routes and API endpoints so only the correct role can access each feature.
- **Validation:**
  - Use Zod for frontend and backend validation.
- **Testing:**
  - Write unit and integration tests for all API routes and UI components.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Use Tailwind for consistent, modern styling.
  - Add loading, error, and empty states for all pages.
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Add notifications, advanced analytics, and mobile responsiveness as needed.

**Work through each feature one at a time, following the steps above. As you complete each, connect the UI to real data and test thoroughly.**
